    "Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers. One of the most common indicators of detecting obesity is to compute the Body Mass Index (BMI). In order to alert potentially obessed people of their status, you are asked to design a program that prompts the user to enter weight in kg and height in meter square. \n",
